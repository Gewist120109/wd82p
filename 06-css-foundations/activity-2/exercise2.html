    <p>
      A <em>potager</em> is a french term for an ornamental vegetable or kitchen
      garden. Often Flowers &#40;edible and non-edible&#41; and nerhs are
      planted with the vegetables to enhance the garden's beauty. The goal is to
      make the function of providing food aesthetically pleasing.

    <h3 style="color: #d9027d">What to Plant</h3>
    <p>
      Plants are chosen as much for their functionality as for their color and
      form. Many are trained to grow upward. A well-designed potager can provide
      food, cut flowers and herbs for the home with very little maintenance.
      Potagers can disguise their function of providing for a home in a wide
      array of forms - from the carefree style of the cottage garden to the
      formality of a knot garden.
